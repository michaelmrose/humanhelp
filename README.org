#+title: Humanhelp
#+subtitle: A less annoying way to find the employees who are hiding from you and make them get you that item that is definitely "in the back" and not still on its way to the store via planes, trains, and cargo ships.

** Pitch
A stupid simple way for to connect people with helpers in real environments with near zero friction.

** Value Proposition

*** USERS
Pull out your phone anywhere use an incredibly simple tool that starts with a singular text input where you describe what you want and a button to summon someone. It doesn't make you think at all, download a 1000 complicated apps one for each location, or navigate their complicated interfaces.

*** COMPANIES
Ensure people are connected to the correct employee expeditiously so skilled employees can turn prospective sales into happy customers that look forward to doing business with you later without investing in doing the legwork yourself to make this happen or needing to convince each customer to install your app.

** Technology used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Express
- MongoDB
- Google places API specifically nearbysearch https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/nearbysearch/output?parameters
  
** Progression

*** MVP

**** User Initial Screen
A Screen where customers enter a query, click help, and are taken to a hopefully short list of locations in the world, this is necessarily not going to be limited to locations supported by the app as we would obviously want to show the user that there isn't supported help here so revert to their normal employee hunting strategies.

**** User Help Screen
A list of zero or more helpers with icons and first names will be shown along with a message that they will be helped soon.  There will also be 2 buttons. A thumbs up for kudos or a big red nasty cancel button for when you couldn't possibly wait 10 more seconds even though you spent 2 hours walking here uphill...in the snow, through razor wire. When a helper has selected you their face will be visually indicated and you will be told so and so will be with you soon.

**** Helper Registration Screen
Helpers with the secret code for a location can register to be displayed as a helper along with the picture from their google oauth sign-in.

**** Helper Customers Screen
A list of customers sorted by how long they've been waiting (for perceived customer time multiply number of minutes by 2 and add half an hour) color coded based on duration. There will be a button beside each customer needing help to assign yourself to the person. They will be notified you are on there way  alongside your grumpy or smiling face or possibly an icon.

*** FUTURE
**** Improve user experience/scalability
Achieved by adding polling or direct connection between service and users with socket.io

**** Helper Team Screen

**** Helper Store Registration Screen

**** Add Simple Chat
Add a button to the help request screen for the customer to add messages to their help request and display a few lines of this text inline on the helpers screen with the option to click the request and see more and message them back.

*** ICEBOX

**** Custom "on the way" Messages
Set by teams or by individual users for playful effect

**** Rating the help you receive
After hitting done rate the help you got

**** Screens and tools for managers

***** Metrics
- Metric about store and invidiously performance insofar as rating and how long people had to wait broken down by any number of criteria and graphed over time to show trends in individuals/groups/whole team. 

***** People
- Assign waiting customers to particular groups/skillsets and see list of people capable of providing help 
- Assign Helpers to Customers
-  View people broken down by skills and schedule

* User Stories
** Current
*** Customer
- As a user I am frustrated when I need an employee to perform a task or provide information and I have to hunt for someone and even when I find them they aren't qualified to provide the kind of help I need. I just want a simple way to get the help I need quickly.

- As a user I would like to know if there are helpers who work at the location I'm at logged into human help.net.

- As a user I would like to know what they do for the company.

- As a user I would like to know if one is coming to help me.

*** Employee
- As a user I would like to easily find people who need my help.
- As a user I would like to know what team members are available and with what skills so I can team up with people to complete tasks.
- As a user I would like to be able to cover my coworkers when they are already engaged so that in turn they will do so same for me.
** Future
*** Supervisor
-  As a user I would like to create a team and control who can join
- As a user I would like to know if there are customers not being helped so I can task the right person to help them.
- As a user I would like to know how many people cancel without receiving help, how fast people are helped and how satisfied they are with the help they get.
